## Introduction


This is a map application with fog covering the whole world digitally. You are an explorer who aims to discover new places on Earth. Each step to a new territory will remove the fog and uncover the place on the map. With this app, you can be aware of which areas you have explored and which places you havenâ€™t. You will realize that there is always too much to explore and will be surprised by how big your little town is. The app also provides you with visualized information on how often you visit a place and keeps a record of your routines when you start the adventure mode. Share your trail or trail memories on various social platforms as well. 
Now download it and explore! Let the trail tell you how your adventure life looks on a map!

Built with Java on top of Android, Foggy App is one of the most engaging exploration app that is 100% free.

**Available for Android.**
